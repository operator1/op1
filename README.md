# op1
Utilities for working with files from the op-1 synthesizer.

## Goals
- To be able to connect a Raspberry Pi to the Op-1 via USB and use it to split a stereo aif file on the album into two mono files on the tape tracks. Ie, a portable and hopefully easy-to-use alternative to faffing around on the computer and doing a bunch of manual steps.
- To take a drumkit that has been made on the op-1 and split it into separate files based on the loop start and end points.
- To take a bunch of samples and convert them into Op-1 drumkits and have the program work out the best way to split them across drumkits efficiently.
